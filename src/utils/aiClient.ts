  I will provide you with a combined code snippet that includes multiple files from a code repository. Each file's content is prefixed with its file path for context. Analyze the overall complexity of the combined code on a scale of 5.5 to 10. Consider the following factors:

- The number of logical branches (if-else, loops, recursion) across all files.
- The depth of nested structures and their impact on readability.
- The use of advanced patterns (e.g., functional programming, design patterns).
- The number of dependencies or external calls present in the code.
- The overall readability, maintainability, and modularity of the combined code.

Provide a single numeric score for the complexity (5.5 = moderately complex, 10 = highly complex). Additionally, provide a brief explanation for the rating, focusing on the combined logic and structure of the code.

Here is the combined code:
